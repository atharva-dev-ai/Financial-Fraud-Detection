# Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A large-scale financial fraud detection system built using XGBoost and Random Forest on a highly imbalanced dataset containing 6.35M+ transaction records.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Handled severe class imbalance (<1% fraud cases) using SMOTE
- Applied feature engineering and correlation analysis
- Trained ensemble models: Random Forest & XGBoost
- Achieved 99%+ Accuracy and ROC-AUC > 0.99
- Implemented hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Built real-time fraud prediction interface using Streamlit

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas & NumPy
- SMOTE (Imbalanced-learn)
- Streamlit

## 📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 99%+
- Precision: 99%
- F1-score: 0.98
